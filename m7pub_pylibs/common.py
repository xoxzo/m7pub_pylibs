    .. warning:: This function is DEPRECATED and is not maintained.

    This class was intended to be the parent class for all classes in MARIMORE
    projects. What this class allows you to do is to get the class name of the
    object as a string via a property call.

    You can do the same easily using the __class__ member, as demonstrated
    here_ without having to use this class.
